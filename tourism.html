<li>Unakoti</li><font size=5><br>
Unakoti is a chiselled wonder hidden in plain sight. Some 178 kilometers from Agartala in Tripura’s Unakoti district, an ancient stone gate opens into massive stone and rock sculptures carved out of a hillside.<br> Serpentine bridges and broken staircases run between the slopes, and a 30-feet tall Shiva’s head, called Unakotiswara Kal Bhairava, stands flanked by sculptures of goddesses—Ganga sitting on a capricorn and Durga standing on a lion. Figures of Hanumana, Ganesha, Ravana and other deities from Hindu mythology are sculpted to perfection. Camouflaged by the dense forests of Jampui Hills, the heritage site stands as a known but forgotten treasure of India. It is called the <b>“Lost Hill of Faces”</b>, and rightly so.<br>
<img src= "god.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br>
<h7>UNAKOTI</h7>
 There was a time, ages ago, when the land of Unakoti was a thriving site of worship. Streams and rivulets flowed by the foothills, the smell of incense lay heavy in the air, and thousands of believers thronged the site for worship. The place had been famous as a Shaivite pilgrimage site from the eighth or ninth century CE until its gradual decline in the modern world. Crafted by expert artisans, the stone sculptures brought the region’s local legends to life. An annual celebration of the Ashokastami Mela every April is the only marker of its former importance.
